```js
const input = `
939
7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19
`.trim()

const lines = input.split('\n')
const targetTimestamp = lines[0]
const ids = lines[1]
  .split(',')
  .map((id) => +id)
  .filter((id) => !Number.isNaN(id))
const earliest = ids.reduce(
  (earliest, id) => {
    const departureTime = id * Math.ceil(targetTimestamp / id)
    return earliest.departureTime > departureTime
      ? { id, departureTime }
      : earliest
  },
  { id: 0, departureTime: Infinity }
)

const result = earliest.id * (earliest.departureTime - targetTimestamp)
console.log(result)
```

## Part 2

I first tried looping like this:

```js
const ids = input
  .split('\n')[1]
  .split(',')
  .map((id, i) => ({ id: +id, offset: i }))
  .filter(({ id }) => !Number.isNaN(id))

function getTimestamp() {
  for (let i = 1; true; i++) {
    const timestamp = ids[0].id * i
    const isCorrect = ids.slice(1).every(({ id, offset }) => {
      return (timestamp + offset) % id === 0
    })
    if (isCorrect) return timestamp
  }
}

const timestamp = getTimestamp()
console.log(timestamp)
```

It worked well for the sample inputs
(took only ~30 milliseconds on my machine for the largest sample input),
but was unpractically inefficient for the real puzzle input.
I even moved the calculations to 10 parallel Web Workers
and let them run for an hour or two,
but didn't get the result in that time.

Then I noticed in the
[Advent of Code subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)
that this problem can be solved efficiently using
[Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem).
After studying a couple of resources,
my understanding is that
the theorem looks and works like this (in math notation):

```text
x ≡ a₁  (mod n₁)
x ≡ a₂  (mod n₂)
x ≡ a₃  (mod n₃)
...
x ≡ aᵢ  (mod nᵢ)
```

Thanks to high school,
I know that the above is basically the same as this in JavaScript:

```js
x % n1 === a1
x % n2 === a2
x % n3 === a3
// ...
x % ni === ai
```

For the theorem to be applicable,
the variables `n₁`, `n₂`, `n₃`, ..., `nᵢ`
have to be
[_pairwise coprime_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_coprime) &ndash;
no pair can have any positive integer factors in common,
aside from 1.
Looks like
all sample inputs
and the real puzzle input
match this condition.

`x`, which is the timestamp in our case,
can be solved with this formula:

```text
x = a₁ * b₁ * (N / n₁) +
    a₂ * b₂ * (N / n₂) +
    a₃ * b₃ * (N / n₃) +
    ... +
    aᵢ * bᵢ * (N / nᵢ)   (mod N)

where:

  N = n₁ * n₂ * n₃ * ... * nᵢ

and where the `b` variables can be derived from these:

  b₁ * (N / n₁) ≡ 1  (mod n₁)
  b₂ * (N / n₂) ≡ 1  (mod n₂)
  b₃ * (N / n₃) ≡ 1  (mod n₃)
  ...
  bᵢ * (N / nᵢ) ≡ 1  (mod nᵢ)
```

Let's take this sample input as an example:

> `67,7,x,59,61` first occurs at timestamp `1261476`.

With these values
the theorem looks like this:

```text
x ≡  0      (mod 67)
x ≡  7 - 1  (mod  7)
(the `x` is skipped)
x ≡ 59 - 3  (mod 59)
x ≡ 61 - 4  (mod 61)
```

The first line is clear
because surely the timestamp (`x`)
has to be dividable by the first ID (67).
The rest can be derived from these alternate forms:

```text
x     ≡  0  (mod 67)
x + 1 ≡  7  (mod  7)
(the `x` is skipped)
x + 3 ≡ 59  (mod 59)
x + 4 ≡ 61  (mod 61)
```

The formula for solving `x` looks like this:

```text
x =   0      * b₁ * (N / 67) +
    ( 7 - 1) * b₂ * (N /  7) +
    (56 - 3) * b₃ * (N / 59) +
    (61 - 4) * b₄ * (N / 61)   (mod N)

where:

  N = 67 * 7 * 59 * 61

and where the `b` variables can be derived from these:

  b₁ * (N / 67) ≡ 1  (mod 67)
  b₂ * (N /  7) ≡ 1  (mod  7)
  b₃ * (N / 59) ≡ 1  (mod 59)
  b₄ * (N / 61) ≡ 1  (mod 61)
```

Let's solve the `N` and `b` variables first:

```js
const n1 = 67
const n2 = 7
const n3 = 59
const n4 = 61

const N = n1 * n2 * n3 * n4 //=> 1_687_931

function solveB(n, i = 1) {
  return (i * (N / n)) % n === 1 ? i : solveB(n, i + 1)
}

const b1 = solveB(n1) //=>  1
const b2 = solveB(n2) //=>  2
const b3 = solveB(n3) //=> 49
const b4 = solveB(n4) //=> 53
```

And now we actually have everything to solve `x`!
Like so:

```text
x =   0      * b₀ * (N / 67) +
    ( 7 - 1) * b₁ * (N /  7) +
    (59 - 3) * b₂ * (N / 59) +
    (61 - 4) * b₃ * (N / 61)   (mod N)

  =  0 *  1 * (1_687_931 / 67) +
     6 *  2 * (1_687_931 /  7) +
    56 * 49 * (1_687_931 / 59) +
    57 * 53 * (1_687_931 / 61)   (mod N)

  = 0 + 2_893_596 + 78_503_096 + 83_594_091  (mod N)

  = 164_990_783  (mod N)
```

Finally,
when we evalute `164_990_783 % N` in JavaScript,
we get `1_261_476`,
which is the correct answer for this sample input.
Hooray!

Now we are ready to solve the puzzle with the real input:

```js
const ids = input
  .split('\n')[1]
  .split(',')
  .map((id, i) => ({ id: +id, offset: i }))
  .filter(({ id }) => !Number.isNaN(id))

const N = ids.reduce((product, { id }) => product * id, 1)

function solveB(n, i = 1) {
  return (i * (N / n)) % n === 1 ? i : solveB(n, i + 1)
}

const x =
  ids.reduce(
    (sum, { id, offset }) => sum + (id - offset) * solveB(id) * (N / id),
    0
  ) % N
console.log(x)
```

It works!
And it takes less than 2 milliseconds on my machine!
`(/^o^)/*\(^o^\)`
(&larr; That's a high five.)

There are some code smells &ndash;
for example,
the `solveB` function is relying on `N` to be in the scope &ndash;
but I think I have learned enough from this puzzle
to not bother refactoring more!

## What did I learn?

Wow, math is hard.
Or at least time consuming.
But ultimately very helpful and useful!

I heard about the
[Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem)
for the first time.
I'm not a mathematician,
so understanding the theorem well enough to use it in my code
took some effort.
A couple of hours, actually. :grimacing:
