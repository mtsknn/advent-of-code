# Day 01

I'm using the sample input here
because the real input is so long.

## Part 1

> Find the two entries that sum to 2020
> and then multiply those two numbers together.

I could have naively used `for` loops,
but I wanted to try to avoid that.
So I used `[].find()`:

```js
const targetSum = 2020
const numbers = `
  1721
  979
  366
  299
  675
  1456
`
  .split('\n')
  .map((s) => parseInt(s, 10))

let result

numbers.find((x, i) => {
  const y = numbers.slice(i + 1).find((y) => x + y === targetSum)
  if (!y) return false
  result = x * y
  return true
})

console.log(result) //=> 514579
```

Okay, this is also very naive.
And lazy.
And inefficient.
But that's okay!
I'm here having fun,
not leetcoding.

## Part 2

> Same as Part 1,
> but find _three_ numbers.

Well, that's easy,
let's just&trade; add an inner `[].find()`:

```js
numbers.find((x, i) =>
  numbers.slice(i + 1).find((y, j) => {
    const z = numbers.slice(j + 1).find((z) => x + y + z === targetSum)
    if (!z) return false
    result = x * y * z
    return true
  })
)

console.log(result) //=> 241861950
```

Beautiful! (Not.)

Just for funsies,
I also tried using simple `for` loops
to see if they would be more readable:

```js
function getResult() {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    const x = numbers[i]

    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      const y = numbers[j]

      for (let k = j + 1; k < numbers.length; k++) {
        const z = numbers[k]

        if (x + y + z === targetSum) {
          return x * y * z
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

console.log(getResult()) //=> 241861950
```

My eyes!

Here's one more,
maybe a bit more readable than the previous:

```js
function getResult() {
  for (const [i, x] of numbers.entries()) {
    for (const [j, y] of numbers.slice(i + 1).entries()) {
      for (const [k, z] of numbers.slice(j + 1).entries()) {
        if (x + y + z === 2020) {
          return x * y * z
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

console.log(getResult()) //=> 241861950
```

Or maybe not.

## What did I learn?

My solutions are not the prettiest.
I would have liked to use maybe `[].reduce()`
and come up with an elegant solution,
but I couldn't.

Surely there must exist a nice and easy solution for this problem?

After some googling,
**I learned that this is called a
[subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)**.
Part 1 can also be called "two sum problem."

After more googling,
I couldn't find any short yet readable solution.
Except [this Ruby solution by /u/Sharparam/ on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8dg41/):

```ruby
input = ARGF.readlines.map(&:to_i)

puts input.combination(2).find { |p| p.sum == 2020 }.reduce(&:*)
puts input.combination(3).find { |t| t.sum == 2020 }.reduce(&:*)
```

So **I also learned about the
[Ruby's `Array#combination()` method](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Array.html#method-i-combination)**.
It seems quite cool!
